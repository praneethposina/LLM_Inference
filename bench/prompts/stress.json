        "I'm developing a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for real-time fraud detection in financial transactions. The system needs to handle millions of transactions per second across multiple geographic regions. Here's my current architecture: We have a Kafka stream ingesting transactions from 50+ payment processors worldwide. Each transaction contains approximately 200 features including merchant details, customer history, device fingerprints, geolocation, velocity metrics, and behavioral patterns. The feature store uses Redis for real-time features and Hive for batch features computed daily. Our current model is an XGBoost ensemble trained on 2 years of labeled data (approximately 10 billion transactions, 0.1% fraud rate). The model latency must be under 50ms at p99. We've noticed issues with: 1) Feature freshness - some features are stale by the time they're used, 2) Model drift - fraud patterns evolve faster than our weekly retraining, 3) Cold start problem - new merchants have no history. Please provide a detailed technical design addressing these challenges, including: real-time feature engineering, online learning strategies, fallback mechanisms for cold start, latency optimization techniques, and monitoring/alerting architecture.",
        "You are conducting a comprehensive code review of a distributed systems library. The library implements a Raft consensus protocol for leader election and log replication. Here is the core implementation to review: class RaftNode implements Consensus { private NodeState state = FOLLOWER; private int currentTerm = 0; private String votedFor = null; private List<LogEntry> log = new ArrayList<>(); private int commitIndex = 0; private int lastApplied = 0; private Map<String, Integer> nextIndex; private Map<String, Integer> matchIndex; private ScheduledExecutorService scheduler; private Random random = new Random(); @Override public void start() { resetElectionTimer(); scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(this::heartbeatIfLeader, 0, 50, MILLISECONDS); } private void resetElectionTimer() { int timeout = 150 + random.nextInt(150); scheduler.schedule(this::startElection, timeout, MILLISECONDS); } private synchronized void startElection() { if (state != LEADER) { state = CANDIDATE; currentTerm++; votedFor = nodeId; requestVotesFromPeers(); } } private void onRequestVote(VoteRequest req) { if (req.term > currentTerm) { stepDown(req.term); } boolean logUpToDate = req.lastLogTerm > getLastLogTerm() || (req.lastLogTerm == getLastLogTerm() && req.lastLogIndex >= log.size()); if (req.term >= currentTerm && (votedFor == null || votedFor.equals(req.candidateId)) && logUpToDate) { votedFor = req.candidateId; send(req.candidateId, new VoteResponse(currentTerm, true)); } } } Please provide a detailed review covering: correctness of the Raft implementation, potential race conditions, performance issues, missing edge cases, and suggested improvements for production readiness.",
        "Design a complete technical architecture for a global-scale video streaming platform similar to Netflix or YouTube. The platform needs to support: 1) 500 million monthly active users across 190 countries, 2) Peak concurrent streams of 100 million, 3) 4K HDR content with adaptive bitrate streaming, 4) User-generated content uploads processing 500 hours of video per minute, 5) Real-time recommendations and personalization, 6) Live streaming with sub-second latency, 7) Offline viewing with DRM protection. Your design should cover: Content ingestion and transcoding pipeline (codecs, resolutions, formats), CDN architecture and edge caching strategy, Video player and adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH), Database design for content catalog and user data, Recommendation engine architecture, Search infrastructure, Analytics and monitoring, Cost optimization strategies, Multi-region failover and disaster recovery, Security and DRM implementation. Provide specific technology choices, capacity planning estimates, and trade-off analysis for each major component."
